Biopolymers (flexible rods), biomembranes (fluid sheets like soap bubbles), and biomolecular bonds are the Lego blocks of cells, used repeatedly inside cells to build a variety of nanometer-sized machines that help perform <em>functions</em>, like allowing cells to divide, crawl, organize their interiors, sense their environment and communicate with other cells. Our group develops physics-based mathematical models of subcellular machines, with the aim of connecting nanoscale architecture to specific cellular performance objectives.
